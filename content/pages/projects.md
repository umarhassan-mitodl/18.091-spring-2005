There is one essay project that does not involve a computer lab. Students receive feedback on their writing and are asked to rework the essays into sections of a single paper. This paper comprises the written component of this course. Students need to write an introduction to the paper and in any paper the introduction is the section where good writing matters most, so they will also receive feedback on the drafts of their introductions.

See the {{% resource_link 3df6ff7f-b24c-c1c5-fc8e-789825b79373 "related resources" %}} section for information on writing mathematics.
